        <p>Originally from Fuzhou, China, Xinmei Li is a current graduate student at Boston University’s College of Communication. Li is actively pursuing a Master’s in Marketing Communication Research alongside an internship in her field at a tech company. In her spare time, you may find her cooking authentic Chinese food, taking photos that capture candid life and swimming. One of her favorite ways to enrich her personal and career development is by choosing a different city to work in each time she pursues a new internship. </p><br>
        <p>As an international student at BU, Li has faced many challenges while navigating a curriculum that runs at a 12-hour time difference. Because of this, she has faced her own mental health challenges throughout the pandemic and wishes to help those who might be experiencing the same.</p>

        <p class="s-bio">A Massachusetts native, Sydney Koo is in her Junior year at Boston University’s College of Communication, pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Media Science. Parallel to her schooling, Koo works as a hostess at The Capital Burger on Boston’s Newbury Street and a marketing intern at a pharmaceutical-based law firm. She likes to unwind by pursuing any sort of visual artistic medium that she can get her hands on--most often, watercolors and charcoal paints. </p><br>
        <P>Koo feels personally entwined with the purpose of this website due to the fact that she has personally struggled with anxiety and depression in the past, some of which has arisen during the pandemic. She sees the focus of the “Your Covid Cure” quiz as a catalyst that can prompt those who are struggling in silence to quietly take steps to begin healing. She thrives on being even a small fraction of the factors that may kickstart those steps.</P>
